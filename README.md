## Editable Dropdown Feature

In this project I implemented the basic functionality for an editable dropdown component.
Users can view, add, edit and delete categories.

Both the 'Add' and the 'Edit' buttons open the same modal and the modal will have the functionality according with the button clicked.

The 'Add category' option has:
1. 'Add category' title
2. Save button that will add a new category to the list of categories
3. Cancel button

The 'Edit category' option has:
1. 'Edit category' title
2. Save button that will edit an existent category and update the categories list
3. Cancel button
4. Delete button that will delete the selected category from the categories list
